ChitChatZone is a room-based chat application. This Full Stack project enables users to create, join, and engage in chat rooms seamlessly. With a focus on real-time communication
ChitChatZone is built with a modern tech stack, combining powerful backend technologies with sleek front-end frameworks to deliver a smooth and engaging user experience.

- **Responsive Design:** Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices for a seamless experience.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Enjoy instant messaging powered by WebSockets for real-time communication.

### Motivation

The primary motivation behind creating ChitChatZone was to enhance my skills in both backend and frontend development. This project serves as a hands-on platform to achieve the following goals:

- **Learn a New Backend Technology:** One of the key objectives was to gain proficiency in Java and Spring. By integrating these technologies, I aimed to build a robust and scalable backend system that supports real-time communication and efficient data management.

- **Enhance Frontend Development Skills:** Another important goal was to deepen my knowledge as a frontend developer. This project provided an opportunity to work with modern frontend frameworks and tools, focusing on creating a seamless and responsive user interface that enhances the user experience.
